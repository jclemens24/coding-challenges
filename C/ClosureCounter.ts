/**
 * Closure Counter
  1. Define the function counter that returns a function that returns an increasing value.
  2. The first value should be 1.
  3. You're going to have to use closures.

Example:
```
const newCounter = counter();
newCounter() // 1
newCounter() // 2
```
Closure:
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
